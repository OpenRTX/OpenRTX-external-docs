# OpenRTX-external-docs

Welcome to the external documentation repository of the [OpenRTX project!](https://github.com/OpenRTX/OpenRTX)

This repository serves as a central collector for all the available information about the current and future OpenRTX targets: here are stored chipset datasheets and reference manuals, unwrapped original firmware images, memory dumps, schematics and all the other stuff useful for reverse engineering and platform support.
